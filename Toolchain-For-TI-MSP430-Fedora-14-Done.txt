TASK : Installation of the GNU toolchain for MSP430

HOST : Fedora 14

STATUS : Enviornment up and running on fedora 14. 

LINKS : http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mspgcc/index.php?title=Linux_installation

STEPS : 

Fedora

su -c "yum install msp430-libc mspdebug"

GDB isn't yet in the repositories, but you can get it here. You can install it by running:
su -c "rpm -Uvh http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/rds/rpm/mspgcc/msp430-gdb-6.8-1.20090621cvs.fc14.i686.rpm"

That's all you'll need to do.

cdk4msp (http://cdk4msp.sourceforge.net/) also has the complete toolchain, but it's outdated.
